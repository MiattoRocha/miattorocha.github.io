				Profile
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				I'm a full-stack software developer with over than five years of
				experience developing solutions using different kind of languages and
				tools. I've been always more interested in why a problem happens than
				the immediate solution. In my life as a software developer, the newer
				technologies attract me, I'm passionate about build the best solution,
				even if I need to learn a new framework or language. I enjoy to being
				creative and meet awesome people that impact the world with their own
				creativity and experience of live.

				<span class="highlighted">TRANSDATA SMART</span> Junior Full-Stack Software Developer
				<br />
				(September 2013 - June 2017)
			</p>
			<p>
				Transdata Smart is an agile environment and with good developing
				practices in your processes, I've been instructed by more experienced
				developers and worked in a more professional environment than in the
				previous companies. The main stack of company is C#.NET, but I created
				one project using Node JS to access bitbucket API, and new web
				applications using AngularJS and others technologies. As a Full-stack
				developer I've taught newer developers our stack and our processes, I
				taught some technologies they weren't familiar yet and I learned about
				theirs experience in previous job.

				<span class="highlighted">SIRA SOLUTIONS</span> Junior Full-Stack Software Developer
				<br />
				(March 2012 - April 2013).
			</p>
			<p>
				SIRA is a small sized company that owns a solution to manage Analysis
				Laboratories focused at food and earth analysis, but the business
				strategy is accept all kind of laboratories even if more
				implementations are needed. The entire solution is built in Delphi 7
				and Postgres SQL with a lot of 'stored procedures' and 'triggers'. That
				was my first experience with automated reports development and for the
				first time I used 'PL/SQL' constantly, creating and maintaining
				'triggers' and 'procedures', also creating complex 'select' commands.

				<span class="highlighted">MOTOROLA MOBILITY</span> Internship as Software Developer
				<br />
				(May 2011 - December 2011).
			</p>
			<p>
				My first professional experience as software developer was in Motorola
				Mobility, a big company. I was allocated in inventory team my job was
				to automate the work of manufacture analysts. There are excel sheets
				using VBA + ORACLE database to collect and organize data to support
				these analysts, I supported and created others solutions to speed up
				manual work, saving time to Analysts make analysis. The factory
				experience and the bureaucracy of big corporations help me to see how
				companies normally works.
